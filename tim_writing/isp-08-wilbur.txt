i thought it was blood but it was just chocolate


I was looking for substance, but all I found was a 24 hour Walgreens. I think the night I realized that we might actually work out was when we discovered our mutual dislike of department store chocolate. It speaks volumes really, or I hope it does. Chocolate, its a refined pod. Its a statement of process. Its royalty. It should not be created or enjoyed or packaged or delivered in haste. I think she knows this too. At least theyâ€™ll be open 24 hours and I heard theres an Imax theatre coming too. 

We are in mourning, we will forever be in mourning. We mourn because unlike Walgreens, what we have lost is irreplaceable.
