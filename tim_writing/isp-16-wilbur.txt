It was fun when they were drinking and good god it was fun when they were drunk, they woke up with new sores on top of old sores and no one said a thing. It didn’t matter really, it wasn’t sad really. Most of them didn’t know what sadness was, they had never gained and never lost. they flew the banner of allied sentiments, carved it into the picnic tables at the park. and when that wasn’t enough anymore, they carved it into their skin. sharing knives and sharing needles, we’re all insiders here. no longer bound by tradition, by value, by a sense of worth. They rode away and they rode away and they died.
