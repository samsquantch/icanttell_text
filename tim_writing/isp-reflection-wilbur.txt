Thats the funny part, Shirley. 

"Im sorry for the mess Ive made of things," she said as she squatted and took a shit on the new carpet in the foyer. To this day I haven't reconciled my emotions on that scene, the rejection of all that was regarded as "holy" was admirable, but the ferocity with which she ruined my carpet was equally as tragic. Come to think of it, and I'm horribly ashamed to say it, I'm not sure I ever even liked her, though she loved all of us dearly. 

Its the stories we haven't told - the ones that maybe we've never even really heard before. You want to be a lost boy? a tin soldier? you want to face death under a cotton banner sewn by the worn and loving fingers of last years apples? The truth is that we will fall, not in glory and not in shame. No doubt we will fall but thats the only way to get your name sewn into the flag - the same flag that in a decade will be used as a table cloth in a photo shoot to sell overpriced cotton socks worn by malnourished models and made by malnourished children. Socks sold to the spiritually obese descendants of the archbishop of branded content. And oh how we will reap it, the day the dead men rise and dance upon the table.

Why did we come here? Im not really sure but here we are again - perhaps its because we never finished. Because we know we know what's good and we're convinced we can teach them, and that maybe in doing so we will earn our own salvation. Even if we die trying.
