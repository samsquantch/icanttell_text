my mother told me


The day you realize that your parents are not infallible is something else, man. It’s similar to the day that you notice that they have aged. For the first time since your awareness began, they are physically, mentally, or spiritually more seasoned than you could ever remember before. In fact by the time you notice, they’re almost old. They smell a little different or move a little slower. Or maybe they are harder to excite, more keen for tea then that camping trip you’d hoped for. Now you’re scared for multiple realities have just surfaced, shown their ugly mug at the tea party. The sunken relics of adulthood are emerging fast and the safety of your childhood is draining faster and you can’t plug the leaks or find your way back into the womb. 
 
The power of deduction is something else, man.
 
If the systems that bore you, spawned, lay, or delivered you are aging then you are currently or soon or sometime will. You will grow older, slower, tire more easily and be less suited and less motivated to enact the great change you had hoped to see in the world. All of your memories will be tinged in fuzz and honey.
