black cats and bad witches
Now said W. James, God only reveals himself to those who want and expect revelation.

Black cats and bad witches, I can’t find a way in. I don’t want to be at this party anymore, find your coats and lets go please.

The appeal of religion runs deep with me, the execution and daily practice runs dry. The appeal is in pastoral nostalgia, that is the longing for something I could taste but never touch, an ideal that may never have existed.  The rural pastor sounds harmless and inviting, I know one and she is by far one of the most intelligent and healing humans to be around. She lives right where she ought to, on the edge of a field and on the edge of the woods. Her husband is a doctor, they mend bones and souls. She holds more truth, more weight then any other holy man because she belongs to her surroundings, she does not fight against them.

Black cats and bad witches built the church that I attend.
